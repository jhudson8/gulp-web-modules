      So you've gotten this far... this is what you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have the following directories now
      <dl>
        <dt>public</td>
          <dd>where this index.html file is.  All resources that are to be copied to the build root should be placed here.</dd>
        <dt>config</dt>
          <dd>deployment specific config data will be injected into your application available as <em>global.config</em>.  When running the dev server, the config data used is <em>config/dev.json</em></dd>
        <dt>lib</dt>
          <dd>any files placed here will have their content be injected into the application directly without any scoping</dd>
        <dt>sections</dt>
          <dd>the root of all section content within your application.  Each directory under here will represent a unique section.  Each section should have an index.js which will be the entry point (executed when the section is imported into the running app).  All of the javascript files will be combined to a single javascript file (<em>sections/{section name}.js</em>). The section called <em>base</em> is a special section name that is required.  <em>sectiions/base/index.js</em> will be your applicatin entry point (it will be executed when you include <em>sections/base.js</em> from your html container page.</dd>
      </dt>

      <p>
        Below is a message that is injected into this page using javascript.  The point is to demonstrate the capabilities in a simple way.  This is how it works:
        <ul>
          <li><em>sections/base/index.js</em> uses the <em>require</em> to synchronously retrieve the exports of the sibling <em>message-retriever</em> module.</li>
          <li><em>sections/base/message-retriever.js</em> exports a function called <em>getMessage</em> which returns <em>global.config.message</em></li>
          <li><em>global.config.message</em> comes from the injected configuration file <em>config/dev.json</em></li>
          <li><em>sections/base/index.js</em> uses the <em>requireSection</em> to asynchronously retrieve the exports from another section (called <em>foo</em>).  These exports contain a function called <em>formatMessage</em>.  The return value is set in this html page.</li>
          <li><em>sections/foo/index.html</em> exports the <em>formatMessage<em> function as a section export using <em>section.exports</em></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Message:
        <div id="message"></div>
      </p>

  </body>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="sections/base.js"></script>
